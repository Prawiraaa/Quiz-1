	<p>The first place is Mongolian Tent You might not be expecting typical Mongolian lodgings in Indonesia but this is exactly what you will find if you make your way to Kota Bunga Estate in the Highland Resort in Puncak.

		There are a huge range of different houses and hotels to choose from here including English style homes and Japanese cottages and you can even stay in a Mongolian camp.
		
		This is more like upscale camping (known as glamping!) than roughing it in the wild and you will find tents have beds, sofas, and even toilets and air conditioning in your tent to ensure that you have a comfortable stay.  </p>
